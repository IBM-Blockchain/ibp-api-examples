# ibp-api-examples

This repository contains some examples showing how the IBM Blockchain Platform API can be used. 
Documentation and further examples on each api are in the [main documentation](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/blockchain).

The examples here will use more APIs, and usually presented as CLI tools. 

> They are examples only of how the API is used - and should be used for educational reasons only.

Please do you own validation and testing if you take these as the basis for any production system.
